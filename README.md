This action runs [delete-workflow-runs](https://github.com/tagdots/delete-workflow-runs) to delete GitHub Action workflows runs.

## ‚≠ê Why switch to delete-workflow-runs-action?
Among all the actions on the GitHub marketplace that delete workflow runs,

- we share evidence of "coverage run" tests in action (click Code Coverage badge).
- we reduce your supply chain risks with `openssf best practices` in our SDLC and operations.
- we identify orphan workflow runs that should be deleted when the parent workflow is deleted.
- we produce API rate limit consumption estimate in dry-run, so you can plan your delete task properly.

## üòé GitHub Action workflow examples

Use the workflow examples below to create your own workflow inside `.github/workflows/`.

### Example 1 - summary
**delete-workflow-runs-action**:

* runs on a scheduled interval - every day at 5:30 pm UTC  (`- cron: '30 17 * * *'`)
* uses GitHub Token with permissions: `actions: read` and `contents: read`
* performs a **MOCK delete** and provides an estimate of API rate limit consumption (`dry-run: false`)
* keeps the last 10 workflow runs for each workflow and delete the rest (`min-runs: 10`)

### Example 1 - workflow
```
name: delete-workflow-runs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read

jobs:
  delete-workflow-runs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read

    - name: Run stale-workflow-runs
      id: stale-workflow-runs
      uses: tagdots/delete-workflow-runs-action@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # 1.0.0
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        repo-url: ${{ github.repository }}
        min-runs: 10
        dry-run: true
```

### Example 2 - summary
**delete-workflow-runs-action**:

* runs on a scheduled interval - every day at 5:30 pm UTC  (`- cron: '30 17 * * *'`)
* uses GitHub Token with permissions: `actions: write` and `contents: read`
* performs a REAL delete (`dry-run: false`)
* keep the workflow runs in the last 10 days for each workflow and delete the rest (`max-days: 10`)

### Example 2 - workflow
```
name: delete-workflow-runs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read

jobs:
  delete-workflow-runs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      actions: write
      contents: read

    - id: delete-workflow-runs
      uses: tagdots/delete-workflow-runs-action@main
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        repo-url: ${{ github.repository }}
        max-days: 10
        dry-run: false
```

### Example 3 - summary
**delete-workflow-runs-action**:

* runs on a scheduled interval - every day at 5:30 pm UTC  (`- cron: '30 17 * * *'`)
* uses GitHub Token with permissions: `actions: read` and `contents: read`
* performs a REAL delete (`dry-run: true`)
* keeps the workflow runs in the last 10 days for each workflow and delete the rest (`max-days: 10`)
* gets data from workflow run to feed data for another steps/jobs e.g. notification or delete action

### Example 3 - workflow
```
name: delete-workflow-runs

  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

        dry-run: true

    # use GITHUB_OUTPUT for integration with other tools
    # e.g.
    # 1. notifications if orphan_ct is not 0 or active_ct is over N threshold
    # 2. use the last step for dry-run, and build another delete-workflow-runs to trigger real delete
    # ....etc.
    - name: Get data and set GITHUB_OUTPUT
      id: get_data
      shell: bash
      run: |
        # get data from the last step to set GITHUB_OUTPUT
